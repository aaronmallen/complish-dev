# Complish

## Universal Accomplishment Recall

Complish is an accomplishment aggregation platform designed around a core principle: **you should be able to recall what
you accomplished during any time period, regardless of which tools you used**.

## The Problem

Your work is scattered across multiple tools - Jira tickets, GitHub commits, Notion pages, Slack conversations, calendar
meetings, Linear issues, Todoist tasks, and more. When performance review time comes, or a client asks for a project
update, or you just want to reflect on your productivity, you're left manually hunting through dozens of different
platforms trying to piece together what you actually accomplished.

## The Solution

Complish connects to your existing productivity tools and aggregates your accomplishments into unified, searchable
reports. Instead of replacing your workflow, it enhances it by providing the missing piece: comprehensive accomplishment
recall.

**Supported Integrations:**

- **Task Management**: Jira, Linear, Todoist, Asana, GitHub Issues, and more
- **Code Repositories**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket - automatic commit tracking
- **Documentation**: Notion, Obsidian, Confluence - capture your writing and decisions
- **Calendar**: Google Calendar, Outlook - meeting attendance and time allocation
- **Time Tracking**: Toggl, Harvest, RescueTime - understand where your time went

## Core Value Proposition

Ask Complish "What did I accomplish between March 1st and March 15th?" and get a comprehensive report including:

- Tasks completed across all your tools
- Code commits with change summaries
- Documentation created or updated
- Meeting attendance and key outcomes
- Time allocation patterns

The generated reports are specifically formatted to work seamlessly with Large Language Models like Claude or ChatGPT.
Simply feed the report to your preferred LLM with a prompt like "Please generate a professional performance review
summary based on this accomplishment data" and get a polished, well-written document ready for submission.

Perfect for performance reviews, client updates, billing documentation, or personal reflection.

## Features

### Universal Integration

- **One-time setup**: Connect your existing tools and let Complish automatically sync your accomplishments
- **No workflow changes**: Keep using your preferred task managers, note-taking apps, and communication tools

- **Flexible sync**: Choose which tools to integrate and how often to sync

### Intelligent Aggregation

- **Automatic correlation**: Link commits to tasks, associate meeting notes with projects
- **Duplicate detection**: Smart filtering prevents counting the same accomplishment twice
- **Context preservation**: Maintain the narrative thread between different types of work
- **Timeline reconstruction**: Build a complete picture of how your work unfolded

### Comprehensive Reporting

- **Date range queries**: Generate reports for any time period - days, weeks, months, or custom ranges
- **Multi-format export**: Markdown, JSON, plain text, or structured data for further processing
- **LLM-optimized output**: Reports formatted specifically for AI-powered analysis and summarization
- **Customizable views**: Focus on specific types of accomplishments or particular projects

## Integration Examples

### For Developers

Connect GitHub, Jira, and your calendar to capture your complete development lifecycle - from ticket creation through
deployment.

### For Product Managers

Integrate Linear, Notion, and Google Calendar to track feature decisions, documentation updates, and stakeholder
meetings.

### For Consultants

Connect multiple client tools - their Asana, your Todoist, shared calendars, and time tracking to generate comprehensive
client reports.

## Future Vision

While the initial release focuses on generating LLM-ready reports, future versions may integrate directly with AI
services to provide automated summary generation, intelligent accomplishment categorization, and proactive productivity
insights - all while keeping your data under your complete control.

## Design Philosophy

Every feature in Complish serves the accomplishment recall mission. This isn't a task manager with reporting added on;
it's an accomplishment aggregation system designed to work seamlessly with whatever tools you already love and use
daily.

## Available Interfaces

Complish will work across multiple interfaces to fit different workflows and preferences:

- **Command Line Interface**: For developers and power users who prefer terminal-based workflows
- **Desktop Applications**: Native GUI apps for visual report generation and integration management
- **Mobile Apps**: iOS and Android companions for on-the-go accomplishment review
- **Web Dashboard**: Browser-based interface for report sharing and team visibility

Choose the interface that best fits your workflow, or use multiple interfaces as your needs change throughout the day.
